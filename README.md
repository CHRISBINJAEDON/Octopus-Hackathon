## 🚨 Problem Statement

Human–wildlife conflict affects millions living near forest areas. Traditional deterrents like fire and crackers are unsafe, polluting, and ineffective. Villagers need a safe, smart, and eco-friendly solution to protect themselves, their crops, and livestock—especially at night.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

WildGuard AI is a handheld, rechargeable torch that uses:
- 🔴 Red LED flashes  
- 🔥 Artificial flame visuals  
- 🔊 Cracker-like sound effects  

These features safely repel wild animals without harming them or the environment. The device is portable, instantly usable, and designed for rural communities.

## 🧠 AI & Tech Integration

We are building toward a **Smart Wildlife Conflict Management System** with:
- **AI-powered motion detection**  
- **IoT sensors and species recognition**  
- **Blockchain-based incident logging**  
- **Mobile alerts and community safety network**

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Villager activates the torch during animal intrusion  
2. Device emits deterrent signals (light, sound, visuals)  
3. Future version auto-detects movement and triggers alerts  
4. Wildlife encounters are logged immutably via blockchain
